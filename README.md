# Phase-1-project
**overview**
Microsoft has decided to enter the movie industry by creating its own movie studio. Our goal is to provide actionable insights that will help Microsoft make informed decisions about what types of movies to produce and when to release them

**Business Understanding**
The business understanding is that Microsoft is interested in creating a movie studio and wants to understand the types of films that are currently performing well at the box office. They are looking for actionable insights to help guide their decision-making process and determine what types of films they should create. The goal is to create successful films that will appeal to a broad audience and generate revenue for the company.

**Data Understanding and Analysis**
   Source of data- There were various sets of data that I used for this project. They are:
Box Office Mojo
Rotten Tomato
The Numbers


   Description of data- Box Office Mojo 
 I plotted  two histograms representing foreign gross distribution and domestic gross distribution.
Foreign gross and domestic gross are important metrics in the movie industry that help in data analysis and visualization. These metrics provide insight into how a movie performs in different markets and can help Microsoft make strategic decisions regarding production, distribution, and marketing.
                       Rotten Tomatoes(rt)
I plotted a horizontal bar chart and pie chart to represent the top 10 movie genres .Analyzing the top 10 genres in the movie industry can provide valuable insights for data analysis and visualization. This information can inform key business decisions and help studios stay competitive in a rapidly changing market.
                       The Numbers
The relationship between production budget and worldwide gross is an important factor to consider in the film industry as it can help determine the financial success of a movie. A higher production budget often indicates a larger investment in the film, which can lead to higher quality production values, better marketing, and wider distribution. However, a movie with a lower production budget can still perform well if it has a compelling story, good reviews, and strong word-of-mouth promotion.

ConclusionBased on the analysis of the provided visualizations, I have identified several key insights that can inform decision-making and strategy for movie production and distribution.
Firstly, foreign gross has a higher frequency than domestic gross, indicating that international markets are critical to the success of movies. Therefore, it may be essential to consider international markets when planning the distribution and marketing of a movie.
Secondly, comedy and drama are the leading genres in terms of frequency, implying that these genres have broad appeal to audiences. Therefore, producers can consider focusing on these genres to maximize the potential audience reach.
Thirdly, R-rated movies are leading in terms of frequency, suggesting that adult-oriented content is in high demand. This information can help guide decisions around rating and target audience.
Fourthly, movies with high production budgets tend to have higher worldwide gross, indicating that investment in production can translate to higher box office returns. Therefore, it is crucial to consider budget allocation when planning a movie's production.
Finally, movies released in May have the highest average worldwide gross, followed by June and July, suggesting that the summer months are the most profitable for movie releases. This information can inform decisions around release dates and marketing campaigns.





Summary of conclusions including three relevant findings
Consider international markets: Given the higher frequency of foreign gross, it is essential to consider international markets when planning the distribution and marketing of a movie. Focus on developing strategies to appeal to a global audience and consider partnering with local distributors to maximize reach.
Focus on comedy and drama genres: As comedy and drama are the leading genres in terms of frequency, it may be worth considering focusing on these genres to maximize the potential audience reach. However, it is also important to keep in mind the target audience for the movie and create content that aligns with their interests and preferences.
Consider R-rated content: Given the high demand for adult-oriented content, decision-makers may want to consider producing R-rated movies or including mature content to appeal to this segment of the audience.
Allocate appropriate budgets: As movies with high production budgets tend to have higher worldwide gross, it is crucial to consider budget allocation when planning a movie's production. Allocate appropriate resources to areas such as production quality, marketing, and distribution to maximize returns on investment.

Release during summer months: Given the higher average worldwide gross during the summer months, decision-makers may want to consider releasing movies during this period to maximize box office returns. However, keep in mind the competitive landscape and ensure that the release date aligns with the movie's target audience and genre.
